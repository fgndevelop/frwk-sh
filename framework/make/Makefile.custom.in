# Supplementary Makefile for easy customization of the build process if
# a seperate build process is required (e.g. because the script code
# is split up into several files)
#
# This Makefile is included from the toplevel Makefile automatically
# when present in the toplevel directory.
#
# The rules below are assuming a custom build of the actual script code
# and are just meant as an example

@SCRIPT_NAME@.sh : 
	@echo "*** Add a rule into <$(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))> \
	to customize your build process for <$@>"

clean : 
	@echo "Target CLEAN of custom Makefile"
