2017-01-06	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- changed MAN_DATE to reflect the modification time of the man page body
		  for the demo man page, the date gets hardcoded into the payload

2017-01-05	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- working on the demo man page led to the removal of the mmr utility
		  the entire man page business has been simplified and is now dealt with
		  by the Makefile itself. Goodbye mmr.

2017-01-01	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- moved the template Makefiles from sfw/tmpl to sfw/make so we can
		  provide scripts with a parsed, ready to use custom Makefile in sfw/make
		  rather than leaving it in the sfw directory
		- changed mmr to create a rule for the provided sample man page when 
		  it cannot find a custom man page
		- default man page body resides in sfw/man now (for good)

2016-12-24	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- the "sfw/man/default" directory is removed, it's pointless. The
		  default files (header, footer) go to "sfw/man", the default man page
 		  goes to the script's toplevel directory 

2016-12-23	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- renamed the whole thing from sfw to frwk-sh as the abbreviation
		  "sfw" turned out to be a bit too popular. So the utility is called
		  frwk-sh, the subdirectory with the framework files is still called
		  sfw but is hidden now (it's only edited for developing purpose, anyway)

2016-12-22	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- renamed the "sfw" folder to "framework" (in the source code, that is)
		- renamed the "sfw_init" folder to "cli"
		- renamed the "sfw_init" tool to "sfw"
		- changed the custom Makefile logic to simply include "Makefile.custom"
		  if it is present

2016-11-05	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
  		- removed _sfw_ifs from sfw/header/02_constants.sh as this is 
                  a relict and no longer in use
  		- added the cmdline to the bug report
		- modified sfw/lib/sfw_cli.sh to return the correct option name
		  when a long option's argument is appended to the option with "="

2016-10-21	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- Makefile is now stripping DESTDIR and PREFIX before
		  checking for content
		- INSTALL_PATH now uses $(realpath ...) for cleaner output

2016-09-30	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- Added "SHORT_DESCRIPTION" to usage printing function

2016-09-30	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- Cosmetic changes on sample script

2016-09-26	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- changed sfw_cli.sh to not use a combination like ${foo%${bar#xyz}}
		  as this is not portable
  		- all "runtime" output is now redirected to stderr as that seems to
		  be what others do (and it makes sense if you want to seperate application
		  output from runtime messages)
		- changed is_readable from sfw_std.sh to return error VALUES and not
		  print error messages

2016-08-29	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- changed double into single quotes for quoting arguments when
		  adding them to _sfw_cmdline_arg_list and _sfw_nopt_arg_list

2016-08-23	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- sfw_cli.sh rewritten to use "internal" _sfw_ - style variables
		  
2016-08-19	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- moved add_nopt_arg to is_nopt_arg and rewrote the function
		- replaced "echo" with "runtime_msg" in sample script

2016-08-19	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- removed fatal_error() as it's pointless
		
2016-08-18	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- moved _sfw_print_error_msg() to _sfw_print_msg
		- added runtime_msg()
		- moved missing_arg, invalid_option and more_than_once from
		  the header into sfw_cli.sh

2016-08-17	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- added INSTALL_BIN_DIR (sbin) to Makefile
		- added return value to _sfw_cleanup_hook as otherwise
		  the script potentially exits with a non zero exit value
	
2016-08-15	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>	
		- renamed _sfw_arg_list to _sfw_cmdline_arg_list,
		  _sfw_nopt_list to _sfw_nopt_arg_list accordingly
		- renamed noptv() to nopt_argv()
		- renamed noptc to nopt_argc
		- added _sfw_get_arg_from_list which is used by argv() and
		  nopt_argv 
		- updated sample script

2016-08-14	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Moved argv() code to _sfw_split_list() as this function
		  can be reused by sfwcli.sh, see below
		- added noptc() and noptv() to sfwcli.sh
 		- renamed _sfw_cmdline to _sfw_arg_list (like _sfw_nopt_list)
		- added foreach_noptv() to the sample script to provide an
		  example for the use of noptv() functions

2016-08-13	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
	 	- Added proper argument check to the argv() function

2016-08-12	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Added @SCRIPT_SYNOPSIS_WITH_CMDS@ to the Makefile
		- Beautify the sample script.sh 
	    	- runtime_error() no longer exits the script, the only error function
 		  that exits (and should do so) is usage_error. 

2016-07-31	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Added a test for numerical argument to the fatal_error() function

2016-06-18	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Added a cleanup function and some comments to the sample script

2016-06-16	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Added README and COPYING (license information) to the payload
		- Modified sfw_init script: extracting entire payload when creating
		  a project vs selectively extracting needed files when updating

2016-05-17	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Removed "set_cmdline" function from /header/06_functions.sh
		  The function was hard to read and only used in getopts and argv.
		  It has been replaced with equivalent inline code 
		- added $(INSTALL_PATH_FILE) functionality to the Makefile

2016-05-17	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Changed parameter expansion in printing functions from
		  sfw/header/04_error.sh from "$@" to "$*"
   		- sfw_init now deletes "Makefile.old" if the diff reports
		  that Makefile's didn't change

2016-05-12	<fgndevelop@posteo.org>
		- Changelog started
